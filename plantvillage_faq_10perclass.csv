Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Field observation of characteristic leaf lesions or spots.,Apple Scab — What are the typical symptoms to look for in this disease?,"Look for characteristic leaf lesions: spots, discoloration, or mold on leaves. Symptoms often start on older leaves and may spread quickly under favourable conditions."
Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Farmer notices small circular lesions developing along leaf edges.,Apple Scab — How quickly does this disease spread within a crop?,"Spread depends on conditions: many fungal diseases can spread rapidly in warm, wet weather; mites and viruses spread differently. Monitor closely and isolate affected plants."
Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Grower unsure if symptoms are caused by nutrient deficiency or disease.,Apple Scab — How can I tell if it is a disease and not a nutrient problem?,"Diseases usually produce localized lesions, spots, or growths, while nutrient deficiencies often cause uniform chlorosis or stunted growth. If unsure, compare to healthy leaves and consult extension."

Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Farmer concerned about spread to neighbouring fields.,Apple Scab — What cultural practices help reduce spread?,"Practice sanitation: remove and destroy infected debris, avoid working when plants are wet, ensure good spacing for airflow, and rotate crops where feasible."
Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Grower asking about chemical controls but unsure which to use.,Apple Scab — Are there safe treatment options I can consider?,"Treatment options exist (e.g., fungicides for fungal diseases), but products, rates and legal approvals vary by region — consult local agricultural extension for specific recommendations."
Apple Scab,Apple Scab: User considers pruning infected leaves.,Apple Scab — Is pruning infected foliage useful?,Pruning can reduce inoculum if done carefully and equipment is disinfected between cuts. Remove pruned material from the site to prevent further spread.
Apple Scab,Apple Scab: Smallholder asks whether the produce is safe to eat after infection.,Apple Scab — Is fruit/vegetable from infected plants safe to consume?,"For many foliar diseases the fruit is still edible if not visibly affected, but quality may be reduced. When in doubt, follow local food-safety guidance."
